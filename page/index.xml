&lt;p>My name is Alfero, and I&amp;rsquo;m a programmer with over 20 yearsâ€™ experience planning, designing and building line of business applications that you&amp;rsquo;ve probably used. In other words, I&amp;rsquo;ve helped envision, design, architect, and led the implementation of full software development life cycle projects for more than two decades.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Combining a mix of professional leadership and business strategy, I work with business decision makers to uncover the real drivers behind software-related decisions, determine the optimal course of action and guide the inter-disciplinary teams towards solutions that meet end user needs and business objectives.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I currently work out of my home office in Toronto area, Ontario, Canada and while I&amp;rsquo;m currently employed by Microsoft in the Customer Success team as a Cloud Solutions Architect, &lt;strong>this blog, its content and opinions are my own&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At 19, I began my self-development journey and have since discovered the passion of learning and growing in all dimensions of my life. My general attitude is that there is nothing I cannot learn or do, and I am honored to help folks from all stages of their growth journey!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My mission statement is:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Think greatly, Connect deeply, Learn broadly&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>and I intend to do all three with this site. Please feel free to connect with me on &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/achingono/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

The question that often cannot be easily answered is this whether free speech is fully compatible with diversity, inclusion, and equality?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In light of that, here&amp;rsquo;s a poem I wrote inspired by a recent experience:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>In the land of diversity and inclusion&lt;br>
In a sea of different and tolerant people&lt;br>
There is that one quiet voice&lt;br>
Drowned in collective representations&lt;br>
Denied of individual expression&lt;br>
I hope my friend&lt;br>
You will choose to be&lt;br>
The one to lend&lt;br>
A listening ear&lt;br>
And seek to understand&lt;br>
Before being understood&lt;br>
And opt to disagree&lt;br>
But still appreciate&lt;br>
They have a story&lt;br>
Yet to be told&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>My hope is that at some point we will find a way to recognize, appreciate, and acknowledge the contradictions inherent in inclusion and use the resulting tensions as springboards to push us forward and closer not backwards and further apart.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Thank you for reading.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
